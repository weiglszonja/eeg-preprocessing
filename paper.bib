              the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity
              in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate
              neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires
              expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and
              numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python
              is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge
              by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python
              that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source
              localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional
              connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms
              and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with
              well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data
              analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover,
              MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries
              for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization
              (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging
              ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided
              under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial
              products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy
              development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with
              expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because
              multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help
              share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to
              preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and
              facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers.

  abstract = "We present an automated algorithm for unified rejection and
              repair of bad trials in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
              electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our method capitalizes on
              cross-validation in conjunction with a robust evaluation metric
              to estimate the optimal peak-to-peak threshold - a quantity
              commonly used for identifying bad trials in M/EEG. This approach
              is then extended to a more sophisticated algorithm which
              estimates this threshold for each sensor yielding trial-wise bad
              sensors. Depending on the number of bad sensors, the trial is
              then repaired by interpolation or by excluding it from subsequent
              analysis. All steps of the algorithm are fully automated thus
              lending itself to the name Autoreject. In order to assess the
              practical significance of the algorithm, we conducted extensive
              validation and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four
              public datasets containing MEG and EEG recordings from more than
              200 subjects. The comparisons include purely qualitative efforts
              as well as quantitatively benchmarking against human supervised
              and semi-automated preprocessing pipelines. The algorithm allowed
              us to automate the preprocessing of MEG data from the Human
              Connectome Project (HCP) going up to the computation of the
              evoked responses. The automated nature of our method minimizes
              the burden of human inspection, hence supporting scalability and
              reliability demanded by data analysis in modern neuroscience.",

  title    = "An information-maximization approach to blind separation and

  author   = "Bell, A J and Sejnowski, T J",
  abstract = "We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes
              the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The
              algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input
              distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit.
              Under these conditions, information maximization has extra
              properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The
              nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up
              higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform
              something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the
              output representation. This enables the network to separate
              statistically independent components in the inputs: a
              higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We
              apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party)
              problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10
              speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture
              is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown
              echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive
              dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest
              that information maximization provides a unifying framework for
              problems in ``blind'' signal processing.",
